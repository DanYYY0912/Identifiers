# Identifiers
A Cross-Reference Map for a program is a list of all the identifiers employed in the program, along with the line numbers on which they appear. It is often useful that a programmer has this information on his or her hand during the debugging stage of programming. Identifiers are words used in programs to name variables, classes, methods, or labels and are subjected to strict rules. None of the Java keywords/reserved words may be used as identifiers. An identifier can begin with a letter, a dollar sign ($) or an underscore character ( _ ). The following is a list of Java keywords/reserved words for your reference. They are extracted from https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/_keywords.html.
